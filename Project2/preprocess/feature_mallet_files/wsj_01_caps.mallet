Mr. NNP

, ,
all DT

which WDT

behind IN

So IN

, ,
Mr. NNP

is s VBZ
trying ing VBG

he PRP

But CC
a DT

opens s VBZ
up RP
the DT

of IN

with IN
all DT
that DT

If IN

the DT

for or IN

Mr. NNP

could MD
face VB
the DT

for or IN

or CC
seeing ing VBG

into in IN

Given VBN
that DT

Mr. NNP

The DT

As s IN

a DT

It PRP

( (

Thus s RB

on IN

The DT

of IN

that IN

of IN

result re VB
in IN
the DT

The DT

this s DT

, ,
because IN
the DT

The DT

also RB
contain VBP
a DT

of IN
`` ``

that WDT

the DT

in IN

Muzzling ing JJ

, ,
which WDT

be VB

`` ``

Such JJ

violate VBP
the DT

in IN

that WDT

the DT

the DT

of IN
those DT

Typically ly RB
, ,
these DT

seek VBP

Probably ly RB
the DT
most RBS
egregious s JJ

is s VBZ
a DT

in IN

that WDT

There EX

the DT

Short JJ

One CD
such JJ
proposal NN
regarding re ing VBG

an DT
increase in NN
in IN

to TO
about IN

Currently ly RB

margins s NNS
on IN

roughly ly RB
7 START_NUMBER CD

% NN
for or IN

-- HYPHEN :
making ing VBG

much RB
faster er JJR

critics s NNS

rather er RB

to TO

Futures s NNS

respond re VBP
that IN

Another er DT
proposed ed VBN

to TO

answer er VB
to TO
an DT
`` ``

a DT
reform re NN
instituted in ed VBN

the DT
Great NNP

that WDT

the DT

of IN

when WRB

But CC
in IN

what WP

to TO
make VB

A DT

slow VB

considerably ly RB
